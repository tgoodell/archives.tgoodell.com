            <h3>MEECSO AP Biology Online Textbook</h3>
            <p>A basic landing page that houses links to various Google Photos albums containing photos of assigned reading pages for AP Biology. Since I am no longer in AP Biology, it is not actively maintained.</p>

            <h3>Business Card | Tristan Goodell</h3>
            <p>A rudimentary website concept. The original concept was a simple, lightweight webpage that contained the same information that is found on a traditional business card. Ideally, the domain would be short, sweet, and easy to remember. Sadly, this concept never morphed into something greater.</p>
